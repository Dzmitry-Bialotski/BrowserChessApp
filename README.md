# Browser Chess - web project based on html, css, pure js.
## The real <b> goal </b> of this project is to learn better front-end part of web-development:
<ul>
	<li>Create UX design in Figma.</li>
	<li>Semantically correct pages using HTML5.</li>
	<li>Correct use of css (without using bootstrap or other libs), use BEM methodology.</li>
	<li>Write js part without using frameworks, implement SPA</li>
	<li>To implement chess logic and visualization I used chess.js and chessboard.js libraries that
	you can find via https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js and https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs also chessboard.js require jquery as a dependency, I used it only for correct work of chessboard.js</li>
</ul>
